## How Points Work

### Earning Points

Points are earned automatically for every swap you make on ChameleonSwap. The system tracks your trading activity and awards points based on:

- **Trading Volume (USD)** - The total value of your swaps in USD
- **Weekly Distribution** - Points are distributed weekly based on your trading volume from the previous week
- **Proportional Allocation** - Points are distributed proportionally to all traders based on their share of total weekly volume

### Weekly Distribution

Points are distributed every week based on the previous week's trading activity:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trading Period">
    All swaps made during a calendar week (Monday-Sunday, UTC) are tracked.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Volume Calculation">
    Your total trading volume in USD is calculated by summing all swap values (`notionalUsd`) from that week.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Point Allocation">
    A fixed pool of points (default: 1,000,000 points) is distributed proportionally:
    - Your share = (Your USD Volume / Total USD Volume) × Total Points Pool
    - Points are rounded to whole numbers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Distribution">
    Points are credited to your account and appear in your points balance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Points are distributed automatically by the system. You don't need to claim them - they appear in your account after distribution.
</Note>

### Viewing Your Points
