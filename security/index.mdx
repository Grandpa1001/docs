## Wallet Security

### Protecting Your Seed Phrase

Your seed phrase (recovery phrase) is the master key to your wallet. Treat it with extreme care:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="✅ DO" icon="check-circle">
    - Store it offline (written on paper)
    - Keep it in a secure, private location
    - Use a hardware wallet for large amounts
    - Memorize it if possible (advanced users)
  </Card>
  <Card title="❌ DON'T" icon="x-circle">
    - Never share it with anyone
    - Don't store it digitally (screenshots, cloud, email)
    - Don't enter it on any website
    - Don't send it via messaging apps
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Using Official Channels Only

<Warning>
  **Always use the official ChameleonSwap website:** https://chameleonswap.xyz/
</Warning>

**How to verify you're on the official site:**
- Check the URL carefully - look for typos or misspellings
- Bookmark the official site after first visit
- Never click links from unknown sources
- Verify the site uses HTTPS (secure connection)

**Common phishing tactics:**
- Fake websites with similar URLs (e.g., `chameleonswap.com` instead of `.xyz`)
- Social media links to fake sites
- Email links claiming to be from ChameleonSwap
- Direct messages with referral links to fake sites

### Hardware Wallets

For significant amounts, consider using a hardware wallet:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a Hardware Wallet?">
    A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores your private keys offline. It provides an extra layer of security by keeping your keys away from internet-connected devices.
    
    Popular options include:
    - Ledger
    - Trezor
    - KeepKey
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Benefits">
    - Private keys never leave the device
    - Protection against malware and viruses
    - Physical confirmation required for transactions
    - Works with most Web3 wallets
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When to Use">
    Consider a hardware wallet if you:
    - Hold significant amounts of crypto
    - Make large transactions regularly
    - Want maximum security
    - Are new to crypto and want extra protection
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Verifying Contract Addresses

Before interacting with any smart contract:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the Address">
    Verify the contract address matches the official one. Scammers may create fake contracts with similar addresses.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Official Sources">
    Only trust contract addresses from:
    - Official ChameleonSwap documentation
    - Verified social media accounts
    - Official website
  </Step>

  <Step title="Double-Check">
    Compare addresses character by character. One wrong character means a different contract entirely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Transaction Security

### Reviewing Transaction Details

**Always review before confirming:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Token Addresses" icon="key">
    Verify the token addresses match what you expect. Fake tokens may have similar names.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Amounts" icon="coins">
    Check both "From" and "To" amounts are correct before confirming.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gas Fees" icon="gas-pump">
    Review estimated gas fees. Unusually high fees may indicate a problem.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recipient" icon="user">
    Ensure the recipient address is correct, especially for transfers.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Setting Appropriate Slippage

Slippage protects you from unfavorable price movements:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Slippage?">
    Slippage is the maximum price difference you'll accept during a swap. It protects against price changes while your transaction is pending.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recommended Settings">
    - **Stable pairs (USDC/USDT):** 0.1-0.5%
    - **Normal pairs:** 0.5-1.0%
    - **Volatile pairs:** 1.0-3.0%
    - **Never exceed 5%** unless absolutely necessary
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Risks of High Slippage">
    Very high slippage (>5%) may expose you to:
    - Front-running attacks
    - Unfavorable price execution
    - MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) exploitation
    
    Always use the minimum slippage that prevents transaction failures.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Verifying Token Addresses

Before swapping, verify token addresses:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Token Symbol">
    Ensure the token symbol matches what you expect (e.g., HYPE, USDC, USDT).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify on Explorer">
    Check the token on the block explorer to confirm it's legitimate:
    - Correct token name
    - Expected total supply
    - Verified contract
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compare Addresses">
    If swapping a known token, compare the address with official sources.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Phishing Protection

<Warning>
  **ChameleonSwap will NEVER:**
  - Ask for your seed phrase or private keys
  - Request you to "verify" your wallet
  - Send you direct messages on social media
  - Ask you to send tokens to "unlock" your account
</Warning>

**How to spot phishing:**
- Urgent or threatening language
- Requests for personal information
- Links to suspicious websites
- Promises of free tokens or airdrops
- Requests to "verify" or "update" your wallet

**What to do if you suspect phishing:**
1. **Stop immediately** - Don't click any links
2. **Verify the source** - Check official channels
3. **Report it** - Alert the community
4. **Never share information** - No legitimate service needs your seed phrase
