    2. Connect your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, or other supported wallets)
    3. Ensure you're on the HyperEVM network (Chain ID: 999)

    If your wallet supports WalletConnect, it will work with ChameleonSwap.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What network does ChameleonSwap use?">
    ChameleonSwap operates on **HyperEVM** (Chain ID: 999). You'll need to:
    - Switch your wallet to HyperEVM network
    - Have HYPE tokens for gas fees

    The app will prompt you to switch networks if you're on a different one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to create an account?">
    No, you don't need to create a traditional account. Simply connect your Web3 wallet to start using ChameleonSwap. Your wallet address serves as your identity on the platform.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is ChameleonSwap free to use?">
    ChameleonSwap itself is free to use, but you'll need to pay:
    - **Gas fees** - Network transaction fees paid in HYPE tokens
    - **Swap fees** - Small fees included in the swap rate (paid in the tokens you're swapping)
    
    Gas fees vary based on network congestion and transaction complexity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Points System

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I earn points?">
    Points are earned automatically for every swap you make on ChameleonSwap. The system tracks your trading volume in USD and awards points based on:
    - Your total trading volume
    - Weekly distributions (proportional to all traders)
    - Referral bonuses (if applicable)
    
    You don't need to do anything special - just keep trading!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When are points distributed?">
    Points are distributed weekly, typically after the end of each calendar week (Monday-Sunday, UTC). The distribution is based on your trading volume from the previous week.
    
    Points appear in your account automatically - you don't need to claim them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I check my points?">
    You can view your points in two ways:
    - **Points Widget** - Check the widget in the navigation bar (top right) when your wallet is connected
    - **Points Page** - Visit `/points` for detailed information including your rank, league, and total points
    
    The points widget updates automatically after swaps and distributions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are leagues?">
    Leagues are achievement tiers based on your total points:
    - **Bronze** - 0+ points (starting league)
    - **Silver** - 1,000+ points
    - **Gold** - 10,000+ points
    - **Platinum** - 50,000+ points
    - **Diamond** - 100,000+ points
    - **Master** - 500,000+ points
    
    Higher leagues represent greater trading activity and status in the community.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I advance to a higher league?">
    League advancement happens automatically when you reach the point threshold for the next league. Simply:
    1. Keep trading to earn more points
    2. Reach the minimum points required for the next league
    3. Your league will update automatically - no action needed!
    
    Check the Points page to see how many points you need for the next league.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I lose points?">
    Points are cumulative and don't decrease. However, your rank on the leaderboard may change if other traders earn more points than you. Your total points balance only increases (or stays the same if you don't trade).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I don't trade for a week?">
    You won't earn new points for that week, but your existing points remain. Your rank may decrease as other traders continue earning points, but your total points balance stays the same.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do I get for inviting users?">
    When users you've invited make swaps on ChameleonSwap, you earn **bonus points** based on their trading volume. These bonus points are:
    - Added to your total points during weekly distributions
    - Proportional to your invitees' trading volume
    - Tracked automatically by the system
    
    The more your invitees trade, the more bonus points you earn!

    No, you cannot use your own referral code. The system prevents self-referrals automatically. You can only use codes from other users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change my referral code?">
    No, your referral code is permanent and cannot be changed or regenerated. Once generated, it remains the same forever. Make sure to share it carefully!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many people can use my referral code?">
    There's no limit! You can invite as many people as you want. The more invitees you have, the more potential bonus points you can earn from their trading activity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When do I receive referral bonus points?">
    Referral bonus points are distributed weekly along with regular point distributions. You'll see them added to your total points after the next weekly distribution, based on your invitees' trading volume from the previous week.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is slippage?">
    Slippage is the maximum price movement you're willing to accept during a swap. It protects you from:
    - Price changes while your transaction is pending
    - Large price impacts on big swaps
    - Failed transactions due to unfavorable price movements
    
    **Default:** 0.5% (recommended for most swaps)
    - Lower slippage (0.1%) - Tighter protection, may fail on volatile pairs
    - Higher slippage (1.0%+) - Better for volatile pairs, less protection
    
    You can adjust slippage in the swap settings (⚙️ icon).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my transaction fails?">
    If your transaction fails, try:
    1. **Increase slippage tolerance** - Volatile pairs may need higher slippage
    2. **Check gas fees** - Ensure you have enough HYPE for gas
    3. **Verify balances** - Make sure you have sufficient token balance
    4. **Check network** - Ensure you're on HyperEVM (Chain ID: 999)
    5. **Wait and retry** - Network congestion may cause temporary failures
    
    Failed transactions don't cost gas, so you can safely try again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I check transaction status?">
    You can check transaction status in several ways:
    - **Wallet notification** - Your wallet will show transaction status
    - **Block explorer** - Use the transaction hash to view on [HyperEVM Explorer](https://explorer.hyperevm.com)
    - **ChameleonSwap interface** - Success/error notifications appear in the app
    
    Transaction hashes are provided for all completed transactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is transaction deadline?">
    Transaction deadline is the maximum time your transaction can be pending before it automatically reverts. This protects you from:
    - Stuck transactions
    - Unexpected delays
    - Price changes over long periods
    
    **Default:** 20 minutes
    - Range: 1 minute to 72 hours
    - If transaction takes longer than deadline, it fails (no gas cost)
    
    You can adjust the deadline in swap settings (⚙️ icon).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do I need to approve tokens?">
    Token approval is a one-time security measure required for your first swap with each token. It allows the swap router to use your tokens for the swap.
    
    - **First swap** - Requires approval transaction (pays gas once)
    - **Subsequent swaps** - No approval needed (already approved)
    - **Security** - Prevents unauthorized token access
    
    You only need to approve each token once.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What tokens are supported?">
    ChameleonSwap supports tokens on the HyperEVM network. You can:
    - Swap native HYPE tokens
    - Swap any ERC-20 tokens on HyperEVM
    - Use the token selector to browse available tokens
    - Search by token name, symbol, or contract address
    
    Popular tokens include HYPE, USDC, USDT, and others available on HyperEVM.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the aggregator work?">
    ChameleonSwap uses an aggregator to find the best swap routes across multiple liquidity sources:
    - **Direct swaps** - Single pool when best
    - **Multi-hop swaps** - Multiple pools for better rates
    - **Optimization** - Best price and lowest gas costs
    
    The aggregator automatically selects the optimal route for each swap.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My wallet won't connect">
    Try these solutions:
    1. Refresh the page and try again
    2. Check if your wallet extension is installed and enabled
    3. Make sure your wallet is unlocked
    4. Try a different wallet if available
    5. Clear browser cache and cookies
    6. Check browser console for error messages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm on the wrong network">
    If you see "Wrong Network":
    1. Click the "Wrong Network" button (if shown)
    2. The app will prompt you to switch to HyperEVM
    3. Approve the network switch in your wallet
    4. If HyperEVM isn't in your wallet, you may need to add it manually:
       - Network Name: HyperEVM
       - Chain ID: 999
       - RPC URL: https://rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction is stuck/pending">
    If your transaction is stuck:
    1. Check the transaction on the block explorer
    2. Wait a few minutes - network congestion can cause delays
    3. If it's been pending for a long time, it may have failed (check explorer)
    4. Try increasing the transaction deadline in settings
    5. If truly stuck, you may need to reset your wallet (advanced)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I don't have enough gas">
    You need HYPE tokens to pay for gas fees:
    1. Check your HYPE balance
    2. Bridge or purchase HYPE tokens
    3. Ensure you have enough for the transaction
    4. Gas fees vary - check estimated gas before confirming
    
    <Tip>
      Always keep some HYPE in your wallet for gas fees. Gas costs are typically small but necessary for all transactions.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token not appearing in selector">
    If a token doesn't appear:
    1. Try searching by contract address
    2. Ensure the token exists on HyperEVM network
    3. Check that you're connected to the correct network
    4. Refresh the page to reload token list
    5. Some tokens may not be in the default list - use address search
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Points not updating">
    If your points aren't updating:
    1. Points are distributed weekly - wait for the next distribution
    2. Refresh the Points page
    3. Check that your wallet is connected
    4. Verify your swaps were successful (check transaction history)
    5. Points update after weekly distributions, not in real-time
  </Accordion>
