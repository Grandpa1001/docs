## Token Swapping

The core feature of ChameleonSwap is token swapping. The platform uses an aggregator to find the best routes across multiple liquidity sources.

### Swap Interface

The swap interface is located on the main page (`/swap`) and consists of:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="From Token" icon="arrow-down">
    Select the token you want to swap from. Click to open the token selector.
  </Card>
  <Card title="To Token" icon="arrow-up">
    Select the token you want to receive. Click to open the token selector.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Selecting Tokens

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Token Selector">
    Click on either the "From" or "To" token field to open the token selector modal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browse or Search">
    You can:
    - Browse recommended tokens (HYPE, USDC, kHYPE)
    - Search by token name or symbol
    - Search by contract address
    - View your watchlist (starred tokens)
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Token Details">
    Each token shows:
    - Token symbol and name
    - Current price (if available)
    - Price change (24h)
    - Your balance (if connected)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Token">
    Click on a token to select it. The modal will close and the token will appear in the swap interface.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You can star tokens to add them to your watchlist for quick access. Click the star icon next to any token in the selector.
</Tip>

### Entering Amounts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter From Amount">
    Type the amount you want to swap in the "From" field. You can:
    - Type a specific amount
    - Click "Max" to use your entire balance
    - The "To" amount will update automatically based on current rates
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Exchange Rate">
    The interface shows:
    - Exchange rate between tokens
    - Estimated amount you'll receive
    - Price impact (if significant)
    - Route information (which pools will be used)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust Amount">
    You can modify the amount at any time. The "To" amount will recalculate automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Flipping Tokens

You can quickly reverse the swap direction by clicking the **flip icon** (↕️) between the "From" and "To" fields. This will:
- Swap the tokens
- Reverse the amounts
- Recalculate the exchange rate

### Swap Settings

Click the **settings icon** (⚙️) to adjust transaction parameters:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Slippage Tolerance">
    Slippage is the maximum price movement you'll accept during the swap.
    
    **Preset Options:**
    - 0.1% - Very tight (may fail on volatile pairs)
    - 0.5% - Default (recommended for most swaps)
    - 1.0% - Loose (better for volatile pairs)
    
    **Custom Slippage:**
    - Enter any value between 0% and 50%
    - Higher slippage protects against transaction failures but may result in less favorable rates
    
    <Warning>
      Slippage above 5% shows a warning. Very high slippage may expose you to front-running risks.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction Deadline">
    The maximum time your transaction can be pending before it automatically reverts.
    
    **Default:** 20 minutes
    
    **Range:** 1 minute to 72 hours (4320 minutes)
    
    <Note>
      If your transaction takes longer than the deadline, it will fail and you won't lose any funds. You can simply try again.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Executing a Swap

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Swap Details">
    Before executing, check:
    - Exchange rate looks correct
    - You have sufficient balance
    - Gas fees are acceptable
    - Route information (if displayed)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve Token (First Time)">
    For your first swap with a new token, you need to approve it:
    1. Click **"Approve [Token Name]"**
    2. Confirm the approval transaction in your wallet
    3. Wait for confirmation (usually a few seconds)
    4. The button will change to "Swap"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute Swap">
    Once approved (or if already approved):
    1. Click the **"Swap"** button
    2. Review transaction details in your wallet popup
    3. Confirm the transaction
    4. Wait for blockchain confirmation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transaction Status">
    You'll see:
    - Loading state while transaction is pending
    - Success notification when complete
    - Error message if transaction fails
    - Transaction hash for tracking on block explorer
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Route Information

ChameleonSwap uses an aggregator that finds the best swap routes. The route may:
- Use a single liquidity pool (direct swap)
- Use multiple pools (multi-hop swap)
- Optimize for best price and lowest gas costs

<Note>
  Route information is displayed when available. Multi-hop swaps may have slightly higher gas costs but often provide better rates.
