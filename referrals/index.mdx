## How the Referral System Works

### Generating Your Referral Code

To generate a referral code, you need to meet the eligibility requirements:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reach Minimum Volume">
    You must have at least **1,000 USD** in total trading volume on ChameleonSwap. This ensures active traders can participate in the referral program.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Visit Referrals Page">
    Navigate to the Referrals page (`/referrals`) and connect your wallet if not already connected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Code">
    If you meet the requirements, your unique **5-character referral code** will be generated automatically. The code is permanent and unique to your wallet address.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Your referral code is generated once and remains the same forever. You cannot change or regenerate it.
</Note>

### Your Referral Code

Once generated, you'll receive:
- **Unique Code** - A 5-character alphanumeric code (e.g., `ABC12`)
- **Referral Link** - A shareable link: `https://chameleonswap.xyz/?ref=YOURCODE`
- **Permanent** - The code never expires and cannot be changed

<Tip>
  You can copy both your code and referral link directly from the Referrals page. Use the copy buttons for easy sharing.
</Tip>

## Using a Referral Code

If someone has shared a referral code with you, you can use it to support them and potentially earn bonus points yourself.

### How to Claim a Referral Code

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a Referral Code">
    Receive a referral code or link from a friend, or find one through community channels.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Visit ChameleonSwap">
    Go to https://chameleonswap.xyz/ and connect your wallet.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the Code">
    Navigate to the Referrals page (`/referrals`) and enter the referral code in the "Claim Referral Code" section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claim the Code">
    Click "Claim" to use the referral code. The system will verify and link the code to your wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Important Rules

<Warning>
  **One Code Per User:** You can only use one referral code in your lifetime. Once you claim a code, you cannot change it or use a different one.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **No Self-Referrals:** You cannot use your own referral code. The system prevents this automatically.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Already Referred:** If you've already claimed a referral code, you cannot claim another one. Make sure you choose wisely!
</Warning>

### Automatic Code Detection

If you visit ChameleonSwap using a referral link (e.g., `https://chameleonswap.xyz/?ref=ABC12`), the code may be automatically detected. You'll still need to claim it on the Referrals page.

## Managing Your Referrals

### Viewing Your Invitees

  <Step title="Volume Tracking">
    The system tracks their trading volume in USD from all their swaps.

  </Step>
</Steps>
