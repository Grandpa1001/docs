## Step 2: Make Your First Swap

Once your wallet is connected, you're ready to swap tokens!

### Understanding the Swap Interface

The swap interface consists of:

- **From Token** - The token you want to swap from
- **To Token** - The token you want to receive
- **Amount Fields** - Enter the amount you want to swap
- **Swap Button** - Execute the swap transaction
- **Settings Icon** - Adjust slippage tolerance and transaction deadline

### Making a Swap

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your Tokens">
    Click on the token selector for the "From" field to choose the token you want to swap. Then select the "To" token you want to receive.
    
    <Tip>
      You can search for tokens by name or symbol in the token selector modal.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Type the amount you want to swap in the "From" field. The "To" amount will be calculated automatically based on current market rates.
    
    <Note>
      You can also click "Max" to use your entire balance of the selected token.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Swap Details">
    Before executing, review:
    - Exchange rate
    - Estimated gas fees
    - Minimum amount you'll receive (considering slippage)
    - Route information (if using aggregator)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve Token (First Time Only)">
    If this is your first time swapping a specific token, you'll need to approve it for spending. This is a one-time transaction that allows the router to use your tokens.
    
    Click **"Approve [Token]"** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute Swap">
    Once approved (or if already approved), click the **"Swap"** button. Review the transaction details in your wallet popup and confirm the transaction.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Confirmation">
    Your transaction will be submitted to the HyperEVM network. Wait for confirmation - this usually takes a few seconds. You'll see a success notification once the swap is complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Swap Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Flip Tokens">
    Click the arrow icon between the "From" and "To" fields to quickly swap the tokens and reverse the direction of your swap.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Settings">
    Click the settings icon (⚙️) to adjust:

  <Accordion title="Token Balances">
    Your token balances are displayed below each token selector. The balance updates automatically after transactions.
  </Accordion>
